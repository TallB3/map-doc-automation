SAMPLE_TRANSCRIPT = """00:00:15 speaker_0: Welcome to the Tech Insights podcast! I'm your host, Sarah Chen.
00:00:30 speaker_1: Thanks for having me, Sarah. I'm excited to discuss AI advancements.
00:01:15 speaker_0: Let's start with the elephant in the room - is AI really transforming every industry?
00:01:45 speaker_1: Absolutely. We're seeing AI integration in healthcare, finance, education, and manufacturing. It's not hype anymore, it's reality.
00:02:30 speaker_0: That's a powerful statement. Can you give us a specific example?
00:03:00 speaker_1: Sure. In healthcare, AI is now diagnosing certain cancers more accurately than human doctors. That's not science fiction - that's happening today.
00:04:15 speaker_0: Incredible. What about the ethical concerns around AI deployment?
00:05:00 speaker_1: Ethics must be our top priority. We can't just optimize for performance. We need fairness, transparency, and accountability built into every system.
00:06:30 speaker_0: Let's talk about the future. Where do you see AI in five years?
00:07:15 speaker_1: I predict AI will become as ubiquitous as smartphones. Every professional will have AI assistants helping with their daily work.
00:08:00 speaker_0: That's both exciting and a bit scary. What should people do to prepare?
00:08:45 speaker_1: Learn the fundamentals. You don't need to be a data scientist, but understanding how AI makes decisions is crucial for the future workforce."""
